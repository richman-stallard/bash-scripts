# bash-scripts
Collection of bash scripts I use.

Note about .bashscripts:
Put this in your ~ or whereever you want, then source it in .bashrc (add a line with the following content):

if [ -f "~/.bashscripts" ]; then source ~/.bashscripts; fi

Remember to change the path appropriately if you decide to not put it in ~

The other script(s) should go into any folder in your $PATH, e.g. /usr/local/bin/ and are intended to be bound to WM keyboard shortcuts.
